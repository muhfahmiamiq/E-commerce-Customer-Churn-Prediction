# E-commerce-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## 1. Business Problem

The primary challenge facing our company is the high churn rate among our customer base. Out of a total of 5,630 active customers, 948 customers (16.83%) have chosen to discontinue their engagement with our platform. This elevated churn rate significantly impacts our operations in two critical ways:

1. Financial Implications: The departure of nearly 17% of active customers directly affects our revenue stream.Each customer holds considerable financial value for the company, making this loss a significant concern.

2. Brand Image and Perception: Beyond financial concerns, high churn rates can tarnish our brand's image. The sustainability of our business isn't solely tied to revenue but also hinges on how customers and the public perceive our brand. Elevated churn rates may raise doubts about our product quality and services, potentially impacting our reputation.

Addressing this churn issue is crucial for our business to retain our existing customer base and fortify our brand's standing in the market.

## 2. Solution Strategy

My approach to tackle this issue involves crafting a data-driven solutionâ€”an E-commerce customer churn prediction system. This project will feature a sophisticated machine learning model designed to forecast whether a customer is likely to churn or remain engaged with the platform.
